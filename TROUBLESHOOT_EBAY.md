# ðŸ”§ eBay Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
You're seeing 503 errors when trying to fetch eBay listings. This typically means one of the following:
1. eBay credentials are missing or incorrect
2. Refresh token has expired
3. Decryption of stored credentials is failing

## Quick Diagnostic

### Step 1: Check eBay Connection Status

Open your browser console (F12) and run this command while logged in:

```javascript
// Run this in browser console
fetch('/.netlify/functions/debug-ebay-connection', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')).currentSession.access_token}`
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('eBay Connection Status:', data))
```

### Step 2: Interpret the Results

The response will tell you exactly what's wrong:

- **`connected: false, error: 'eBay not connected'`**
  â†’ You need to connect your eBay account in Account Settings

- **`connected: false, error: 'Decryption failed'`**
  â†’ The stored credentials are corrupted. Reconnect your eBay account

- **`connected: false, error: 'Token refresh failed'`**
  â†’ Your eBay refresh token has expired. You need to reauthorize

- **`connected: true`**
  â†’ Your connection is working! The issue might be with rate limiting

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Reconnect eBay Account
1. Go to Account Settings
2. Click "Connect eBay Account"
3. Complete the OAuth flow
4. Try loading listings again

### Solution 2: Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (should be a consistent 32-byte key)
- `EBAY_APP_ID` (not needed if stored in database)
- `EBAY_CERT_ID` (not needed if stored in database)

### Solution 3: Clear Cache and Retry
Sometimes the function cache gets stuck:
1. Wait 5 minutes (cache TTL)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Try loading listings again

## Error Messages Explained

### "eBay service temporarily unavailable"
This is a generic 503 error. Run the diagnostic above to get specific details.

### "Your eBay connection has expired"
The refresh token is no longer valid. You need to reconnect your eBay account.

### "There was a problem accessing your eBay credentials"
The encryption/decryption of your stored tokens failed. This happens if the encryption key changes.

### "Too many requests to eBay"
You've hit the rate limit. The system has caching to prevent this, but if you see it:
- Wait 60 seconds
- The next request should use cached data

## Advanced Debugging

### Check Function Logs
```bash
npx netlify logs:function ebay-fetch-listings
```

### Test the Function Directly
```bash
# Get your auth token from browser localStorage first
curl https://dainty-horse-49c336.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/debug-ebay-connection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

### Common Issues

1. **ENCRYPTION_KEY mismatch**
   - The key used to encrypt tokens differs from the one used to decrypt
   - Solution: Ensure ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable is consistent

2. **Expired eBay App credentials**
   - Your eBay application credentials might be invalid
   - Solution: Check eBay Developer Portal for your app status

3. **Missing scopes**
   - The OAuth token doesn't have required permissions
   - Solution: Reconnect with proper scopes

## Next Steps

1. Run the diagnostic command above
2. Share the results (you can redact sensitive info)
3. Based on the error, follow the appropriate solution
