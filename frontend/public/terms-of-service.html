  </div>

  <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
  <p>You and OpSyncPro.io, LLC agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved by binding individual arbitration rather than in court, except that either party may bring claims in small claims court if eligible.</p>

  <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
  <p><strong>YOU AND OPSYNCPRO.IO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong> Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.</p>

  <h3>Informal Resolution First</h3>
  <p>Before initiating arbitration, you agree to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@opsyncpro.io">support@opsyncpro.io</a> and attempt to resolve the Dispute informally for at least 30 days.</p>

The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

  <h3>Arbitration Costs</h3>
  <p>If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. For claims over $10,000, fees will be allocated per AAA rules.</p>

  <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
  <p>You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:support@opsyncpro.io">support@opsyncpro.io</a> within <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, email address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.</p>

  <h3>Survival</h3>
  <p>This arbitration agreement will survive termination of your relationship with us.</p>

  <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of Delaware</strong>, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provisions.</p>
  <p>For any matters not subject to arbitration, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Delaware.</p>

  <h2>16. Time Limitation on Claims</h2>
  <p>You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within <strong>six (6) months</strong> after such claim or cause of action arose, or be permanently barred.</p>

  <h2>17. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or prominent notice within the Services. Your continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
